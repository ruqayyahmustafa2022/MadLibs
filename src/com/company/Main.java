        Create 3 size 5 arrays
        One array should have (1) 5 single word strings, each of which is a noun.
                (2) One array should have 5 single word strings, each of which is an adjective.
                (3) One array should have 5 single word strings, each of which is a verb.
                Note: The Java Util class Random has a nextInt() method that can be used to get a random number from the
                range of zero to the number passed in as a parameter.
                (4) Write a small story that randomly gets words from each array to fill in blank points in the story
                based on the word type.
                Donâ€™t forget to stage and commit changes in git as you go along
        Bonus: Get the words to fill each array by asking the user to supply them. */
